[{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you but as soon as you hear the word Kerberos, I immediately want to shy away. For it sounds complicated and scary but what is it? Well, in simple terms, it\u0026rsquo;s a modern authentication that can allow organisations to reduce the reliance on passwords on Windows devices.\nWhy might you need it? Imagine a world where you\u0026rsquo;d like to have Entra ID /Azure AD joined devices, authenticating back to on-premise resources. As long as you have hybrid user identities sync\u0026rsquo;d via AD sync connect, you can have just that but what if you wish to make use of Windows Hello for Business? Then you\u0026rsquo;ll start to run into some problems and users will be prompted for re-authentication. Why, well the on-premise resources, don\u0026rsquo;t trust your WHfB authentication token. This is where Cloud Kerberos trust comes to aid. It allows for WHfB configured devices to access on-premise resources without re-authentication and provide a secure authentication trust between Entra ID and the on-premise AD.\nAlternatives As with everything, in short Yes there are but I\u0026rsquo;d consider these older technology. You have the choice of using a key trust or certificate trust. With the later, even if you have your own PKI infrastructure, I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it. It\u0026rsquo;s much harder to upkeep and to be honest, it\u0026rsquo;s a royal pain, comes with poor user experience (at step up stage) and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really offer anything else for the complexity that it brings. MIcrosoft themselves, recommend Cloud Kerberos Trust!\nSo how does it work? What are the supported scenarios? So imagine, you\u0026rsquo;re moving to the cloud. Existing devices are hybrid domain joined. New pilot devices are Entra joined via Windows Autopilot and you\u0026rsquo;re slowly moving workloads over from on-premise. How does this fit? Well in short, it supports both. So you can deploy CKT, deploy one configuration to devices or users and it\u0026rsquo;ll, well just work!\nDevices do need support Windows Hello for business for all this to work but that comes down to the device. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you research this part!\nHow to deploy it\u0026hellip; This comes in two parts, setting up the kerberos trust and deploying Windows Hello configuration. Do not deploy the Windows Hello configuration to devices or users, until the Cloud Kerberos configuration is in place. Doing so will mean that users will need to delete their WHfB and start again for it to take place.\nSet up Cloud Kerberos Trust Step 1 - First, ensure TLS 1.2 for PowerShell gallery access.\n1 [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Step 2 - Install the AzureADHybridAuthenticationManagement PowerShell module.\n1 Install-Module -Name AzureADHybridAuthenticationManagement -AllowClobber Step 3 - Create the new Entra ID Kerberos Server object in Active Directory\n1 2 $GAUser = \u0026#34;PlaceYourAdminCreds@tenantdomain.com\u0026#34; Set-AzureADKerberosServer -Domain $env:UserDNSDomain -UserPrincipalName $GAUser Step 4 - Now you\u0026rsquo;re done but lets verify it\n1 Get-AzureADKerberosServer You should see something like this\u0026hellip;\nIf you look on a domain controller within Users and Computer, you should see 2 new objects created. These act like a read only domain controller. They provide the mechanism to provide part of the Primary Refresh Token (PRT) that users need to authenticate.\nDo not delete/move/rename these 2 objects. To do so will break your new Cloud Kerberos Trust!\nIntune Configuration Create Windows Hello for Business Configuration Profile Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to create and deploy the WHfB configuration. Here is an example settings catalog profile to deploy WHfB will all the necessary settings. Make amendments as you see fit, the important one is highlighted in yellow. Use Cloud Trust for on prem auth, just make sure that\u0026rsquo;s enabled!\nDeploy it to users or devices. Once the user logs back into the device, they should receive a message to setup Windows Hello. User Setup This works in the exactly the same way as it would without kerberos trust so the user won\u0026rsquo;t notice anything different. They sign in, go through the MFA Prompt and setup faceID, fingerprintID and then a PIN code. Once set, they\u0026rsquo;ll be logged in and WHfB will be the new default sign in option.\nThis is one of the biggest benefits of using this method. Whereas using a key trust or certificate trust, means that when a user sets up for the first time, they can\u0026rsquo;t immediately start using it, they have to wait upwards of 60 mins for the device objects in Active Directory to be updated. Not the case with Cloud Kerberos Trust. Use it straight away!\nUser Experience. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to give you a screen shot of the setup process or accessing on premise file shares. As long as the user has line of sight to the file share, to test Cloud Kerberos, have them sign in with WHfB on the device and access a file share. If it just opens, success! If it prompts for a username/password, we have problems! I\u0026rsquo;d run the Get-AzureADKerberosServer to check the status.\nThanks for reading!\n","date":"2025-07-05T16:56:34+01:00","image":"https://endpointmgt.com/p/whfbcloudkerberos/post/WHfBCloudKerberos/img/cover_hu_92706ff7ad7eb60.png","permalink":"https://endpointmgt.com/p/whfbcloudkerberos/","title":"Windows Hello for Business and Cloud Kerberos Authentication"},{"content":"On a recent engagement in my day job, I had a challenge to deploy Solus3 agent to Microsoft Entra joined devices. These devices were enrolled via Windows Autopilot and no longer domain joined. The existing deployment deployed the Solus3 agent via a targeted AD OU, which deploys the agent via the deployment server. This of course, isn‚Äôt possible with Entra joined devices.\nTo get this to work, its a wrap within a wrap. Keeping it as close the production or what your using or how you might already deploy the app as close the the existing deployment but with a few tweaks. Anyways for now, here are the steps to deploy the agent via Microsoft Intune. After all, it‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here üôÇ\nIt should be noted that this approach to deployment is NOT supported. Do so at your own risk. You may still need to keep an instance of a supported deployment. This will allow you to replicate the any issue on a supported deployment for escalation.\nPreparation You‚Äôll need to gather the relevant files and create a folder for the install files, called SIMS. In my example, I‚Äôve placed the SIMS folder on the root of the D:\\ drive. Copy the following files over to the SIMS folder.\nSOLUS3AgentInstaller_x86.msi SOLUS3AgentInstaller_x64.msi Solus3.Keys.DeploymentService.Public.xml First installer File Create a .bat file named Solus3AgentInstaller.bat with the following commands.\n1 cscript.exe //nologo AgentInstaller.js \u0026#34;agent_installer.log\u0026#34; \u0026#34;net.tcp://localhost:52966\u0026#34; \u0026#34;net.tcp://Your-SIMS-Server:52965\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Solus3.Keys.DeploymentService.Public.xml\u0026#34; \u0026#34;SOLUS3AgentInstaller_x86.msi\u0026#34; \u0026#34;SOLUS3AgentInstaller_x64.msi\u0026#34; Update the net.tcp://Your-SIMS-Server:52965 with your server location and save the .bat file in your newly created SIMS folder.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 var wshShell, wshSysEnv; var fso, f1, typeLib; fso = new ActiveXObject(\u0026#34;Scripting.FileSystemObject\u0026#34;); typeLib = new ActiveXObject(\u0026#34;Scriptlet.TypeLib\u0026#34;); wshShell = WScript.CreateObject(\u0026#34;WScript.Shell\u0026#34;); var logFileName = WScript.Arguments(0); var agentAddress = WScript.Arguments(1); var dsAddress = WScript.Arguments(2); var keyFileName = WScript.Arguments(3); var msi32 = WScript.Arguments(4); var msi64 = WScript.Arguments(5); var msi = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; if (is64()) msi = msi64; else msi = msi32; wshShell.Run(\u0026#34;msiexec.exe /qb /lv* \\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + fso.BuildPath(wshShell.Environment(\u0026#34;SYSTEM\u0026#34;)(\u0026#34;TEMP\u0026#34;), logFileName) + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; /i \\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + wshShell.CurrentDirectory + \u0026#34;\\\\\u0026#34; + msi + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; AGENTSERVICEADDRESS=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + agentAddress + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; AGENTID=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + typeLib.Guid.toString().substring(0, 38) + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; DEPLOYMENTSERVERADDRESS=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + dsAddress + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; RSAKEYPATH=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + wshShell.CurrentDirectory + //\u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; PREDEFINEDAGENTTARGETS=\\\u0026#34;Sims Fms Discover\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 0, true); function is64() { var shell = WScript.CreateObject(\u0026#34;WScript.Shell\u0026#34;); return (wshShell.Environment(\u0026#34;SYSTEM\u0026#34;)(\u0026#34;PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE\u0026#34;).indexOf(\u0026#34;64\u0026#34;) + 1); } Save the AgentInstaller.js file in your newly created SIMS folder.

You should now have the app installed.\nNext Steps. Now that you have the Agent installed. You‚Äôll need to login to the Solus3 server and deploy the Sims package to the device from the deployment server.\nWhile this will deploy the Solus3 agent to devices, what this doesn‚Äôt take care of is ongoing updates. You‚Äôll need to package any updates to the Solus3 agent. It‚Äôs beyond the scope of this article.\nFor now and until the next post, I wish you well‚Ä¶\n","date":"2025-01-29T19:45:32+01:00","image":"https://endpointmgt.com/p/deploysims/post/InstallSims/img/cover_hu_fcfa45c016b79c7b.png","permalink":"https://endpointmgt.com/p/deploysims/","title":"Deploy SOLUS 3 for SIMS"},{"content":"Missing this app in your M365 tenant and need it for Conditional Access? This was a recent issue that I came across while working on a tenant to tenant migration project. The Issue?

The only problem, only the Microsoft Intune app existed.\nAs you can see below, the Microsoft Intune app is missing from the Mobility MDM and WIP page.\nAs you can also see, it‚Äôs missing from the Target Resources within the Conditional Access Policies.\nTo resolve the issue, we need a way of recreating the app that Microsoft will recognise as the Intune enrolment app, we can‚Äôt simply create an Enterprise Application called the same name.

But what is it? MAM stands for Mobile Application Protection and Windows, instead a mobile OS, so what does Microsoft mean when they say MAM for Windows? Well, it‚Äôs in essence, it‚Äôs App Protection for Windows. It applies to the Edge Browser and can provide organisations with the ability to provide their end users with secure M365 access on personally owned unmanaged devices while applying some level of data protection controls.\nSo we know what is it but how does it work? If all the requirements are met, once setup, the user just has to sign in to Office and they‚Äôll be taken through the process and well apart from one slightly misleading screen where it could all come crashing down, more on that later, it‚Äôs a fairly easy process for users to follow and makes accessing M365 almost easier.\nWe‚Äôll take a look at\nThe prerequisites The users experience both in setup and use The configuration from an Intune Admins perspective What else did we see? What didn‚Äôt we see that we maybe expected? What are the prerequisites‚Ä¶ If you look at the Microsoft tech announcement, it will told us that it‚Äôs Windows 11 and Microsoft Edge for Windows ver. 117 and above. With the updated learn article Data protection for Windows MAM | Microsoft Learn, this was changed to support Windows 10 running build 19046.3636 and above with KB5031445 or later.\nWindows 10, build 19046.3636, KB5031445 or later and Windows 11, build 10.0.22621.2506, KB5031455 (22H2) or later Microsoft Intune (2309 release) Microsoft Edge (v117 stable branch and later for Windows 11 and v118.0.2088.71 and later for Windows 11) Windows Security Center (v 1.0.2310.2002 and later) if using Device Risk scores Users must be assigned a licence for Microsoft Intune and a Conditional Access P1 or P2 licence. The Setup‚Ä¶ The first thing users will see when they sign in is a conditional access message saying that they‚Äôll need to sign into the Edge Browser or access the account from a registered device. (we‚Äôll not get into the later, you never know, I may do another post on this separately).\nHere‚Äôs a quick step by step run though of what it looks like for the user\nthey‚Äôll sign into Office.com with their organisational account User will be asked to create a work profile, they simply need to select the account and select the Sign in to Sync data and they‚Äôll then be prompted for their password. This is where it gets interesting, the user is provided with a a couple of options on this screen. We need them to register the device but not enrol and allow the organisation to manage the device. Managed devices will block MAM for Windows from working so the user has to untick Allow my organisation to manage my device and then select OK. they only sign into the app by selecting No, this won‚Äôt register the device and they‚Äôll get stuck in a loop with MS Edge asking them to sign in and create a work profile. You have been warned.\nOnce signed in, the work profile will be created, a couple of customisation screens will appear, they can tailor the browser or simply just click Continue, Next and Done. And its done. A user will now have SSO when they use the Microsoft Edge browser using the newly created Work Profile.\nIn Practice‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs the subtle difference between the Personal and Work profiles signed in and how you can select between the two.\n, Trying to download files from OneDrive / SharePoint is blocked (as per our requirement) along with the ability to download the Office installer, rather unexpectedly but when you think about it logically, you can understand why.\n, How was it configured‚Ä¶ Configuration is carried out in 2 parts. You first have to great an App Protection Policy, followed by a Conditional Access Policy to enforce it.\nApp Protection The App Protection Policy is created within Intune here ‚Äì Apps ‚Äì Microsoft Intune admin center and you‚Äôll need the role of Intune Admin or Global Admin (GA) to create this policy. The policy is broken down into 2 areas;\nData protection Health Checks (otherwise known as Conditional Launch) Data Protection allows admins to select where the managed profile can receive data from, send and receive organisational data, whether to allow cut, copy and past and decide if users can print organisational data.\nHealth Checks allow admins to set criteria that must be met before a user can access M365 data via the work profile, such as Minimum OS, Minimum Edge version and id their account is disabled. It can also use the devices risk score from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint if used to secure unmanaged devices. (we‚Äôll not cover this aspect here)\nOnce the App Protection Policy is configured, it would be prevalent to assign this to a test group of users before deploying this to production.\nConditional Access The Conditional Access Policy is created within Intune or Entra ID ‚Äì Conditional Access ‚Äì Microsoft Intune admin center and you‚Äôll need the role of Conditional Access Admin or Global Admin (GA) to create this policy.\nThis article isn‚Äôt designed to teach you how to use CA policies, if you are unfamiliar with these, improve your knowledge here ‚Äì What is Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID? | Microsoft Learn\nBelow is the policy that I created, targeting O365 apps, on windows, via a browser to require app protection. My policy did not follow the Microsoft guidance to either require app protection or require a compliant device. Consider your use case carefully.\nWhat else did we see‚Ä¶ An interesting one here, the Minimum OS was originally set to block older OS but regardless of the version of OS, I found that it always blocked it, even if the OS version was higher. As you can see from below, I changed this to warn so that I could continue but it‚Äôs still complaining, despite the Windows version being equal.\nWhat didn‚Äôt see see or would like For me, it‚Äôs around 2 aspects.\nThe user setup process is confusing that users have to untick the box or face having their device managed. This could be must tidier if Microsoft revised this part of the process.\nThe second is around the app protection policy with there being no access requirements that you get on both iOS and Android App Protection Policies. This means that admins can‚Äôt set a PIN or password requirement for users. This missing feature alone may rule out this being a viable option for some organisations.\nFurther Info Here‚Äôs the official docs from Microsoft\nData protection for Windows MAM | Microsoft Learn Frequently asked questions about MAM and app protection | Microsoft Learn Conditional Access ‚Äì Require app protection policy for Windows | Microsoft Learn ","date":"2023-10-13T11:18:38+01:00","image":"https://endpointmgt.com/p/mamforwindows/post/MamForWindows/Img/cover_hu_480cb478178bc1c5.png","permalink":"https://endpointmgt.com/p/mamforwindows/","title":"MAM for Windows"},{"content":"If you‚Äôre in a Hybrid environment using SCCM and Intune already or in the process of moving to a Hybrid deployment, a decision that will need to be made is where you direct users to install applications.\nMany of you may have already deployed the company portal but in this post; I‚Äôll look at the benefits of deploying company portal to Windows devices, how to deploy it to devices, what‚Äôs visible within Company Portal and what the user experience is.\nWhy Should we move I‚Äôll keep this part brief as Microsoft already do a very good job of making recommendations on why you should move but for me, it‚Äôs about consistency for users.
