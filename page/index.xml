I’m Chris Sellar, and I’m the creator of endpointmgt.com. With experience in both the private and public sector IT in the UK, I earn my keep as a Cloud Endpoint Technical Consultant for a large Microsoft Partner and software reseller in the UK. My unique position as a technology leader has given me valuable insight into the world of IT, and I hope to share some of that knowledge through my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of my blog will be on Microsoft Intune, Configuration Manager, Windows Autopilot, and Windows 11. I aim to use it as a practical how-to guide, sharing my personal experiences to help others navigate the world of IT more easily. Any useful how-to guides I create will be posted on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to working in the field of IT for many years, I also have a first class honors degree in IT Management for Business from Robert Gordon University. Along with an ever increasing number of Microsoft certifications, thanks to my current employers willingness for continuous personal development. To that end, I’m delighted to have passed the &lt;a class="link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-gb/ChrisSellar-8412/606E4B574C771B5D?sharingId=B707E2744889D373" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;M365 Admin Expert certification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
